# Technical Assessment

A technical assessment question:

Please provide a demonstration by setting up a basic master configuration using an Angular frontend component that includes the functionality of search, addition, and updating data, while also utilizing an API with an ORM? Additionally, Do commit the code to Github and provide us with the necessary steps to execute it.

Sample guideline:

Set up an Angular project using the Angular CLI.
Create a frontend component that includes a form for adding or editing data and a table for displaying data.
Use Angular's built-in HTTP client or a third-party library like rxjs to make API calls to your backend server.
On the backend side, set up a RESTful API using your preferred web framework and ORM, such as Express.js and Sequelize for Node.js.
Define the API endpoints for CRUD operations (i.e., GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE).
Implement the database models and schema using the ORM.
Write the server-side code for handling the API requests and responses.
Test the API endpoints using a tool like Postman or curl.
Finally, commit the code to Github and provide the necessary steps to execute it.
Keep in mind that these steps are general guidelines, and the specific implementation will vary depending on your requirements and the tools you choose to use.
